Welcome to the benCoding.basicGeo Titanium project

<h2>Features</h2>

The benCoding.basicGeo module provides enhanced geo location functionality over the core Titanium framework. For example you can access the native platform reverse geo decoders, or use the built in distance calculations methods.

<h2>Project Information</h2>

The goal of this project is to provide access to the underlying platform components.  This at times makes the API difficult in a cross platform manor. In these cases it is recommended you abstract the differences in your Titanium JavaScript code.

Because of these differences iOS and Android contain their own sub projects with platform specific documentation and examples.
